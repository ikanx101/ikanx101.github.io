Perkembangan model AI belakangan ini membuat saya kagum. Bagaimana
tidak? Baru beberapa tahun lalu saya mencoba beberapa model berikut:

1.  [*Image recognition* menggunakan Google Vision
    AI](https://ikanx101.com/blog/google-vision/).
2.  [Komparasi *image recognition* antara Google Vision AI vs Microsoft
    Azure Vision AI](https://ikanx101.com/blog/azure-vis/).
3.  [Komparasi *optical character recognition* yang terbaik antara
    Google Vision, Microsoft Azure Vision, dan
    Tesseract](https://ikanx101.com/blog/ocr-3ways/).

Ternyata model AI yang ada saat ini sudah **melompat sedemikian
jauhnya**.

lain. Berikut hasilnya:
