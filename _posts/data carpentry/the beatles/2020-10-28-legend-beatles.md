Siapa sih yang tidak mengenal *band* legendaris Inggris *The Beatles*?
Mungkin cuma anak-anak *millenials* yang gak pernah mendengarnya *yah*.
*hehe.*

Ceritanya, saat SMA saya dan beberapa teman memiliki kesukaan terhadap
lagu-lagu *The Beatles*. Hingga suatu momen kami nge-*band* dan
nge-*jam* lagu-lagu tersebut. Tidak disangka ternyata ayah dari salah
satu teman saya memiliki *official books* dari *The Beatles*.

Walaupun buku tersebut berisi banyak hal mengenai *John Lennon* dan
*Paul McCartney* *cs*, saya hanya tertarik pada bagian partitur dan
*chord* lagu-lagunya. Ada satu *urban legend* yang ditulis di buku
tersebut:

> **Konon katanya, semua lirik lagu the Beatles ditulis dari sudut
> pandang orang pertama.**

Maksudnya, lirik lagunya selalu menggunakan kata `saya` (dalam bahasa
inggris jadi *me*, *I*, *my* atau *mine*). Jadi bukan bercerita dari
sudut pandang orang ketiga.

Sekian tahun berlalu hingga kini saya punya cara untuk membuktikan
kebenaran dari *urban legend* tersebut. Apakah benar semua lagu *The
Beatles* ditulis dari *1st person POV*?

-----

Berdasarkan informasi dari *Google* dan *Wikipedia*, setidaknya *The
Beatles* telah membuat setidaknya `117` buah lagu. Tapi, kalau saya cek
di beberapa situs lain seperti:
[www.lyricsfreak.com](https://www.lyricsfreak.com/), jumlahnya mencapai
`200` buah lagu.

Saya kemudian *scrape* semua judul dan lirik lagu dari *The Beatles*
dari situs tersebut. Berikut adalah *sample* datanya:

## Apakah semua lagu ditulis dengan *1st POV*?

Ternyata, dari `200` lagu yang ada tersebut, ada `22` lagu yang secara
eksplisit tidak menggunakan kata `saya`.

Ternyata *urban legend* tersebut tidak sepenuhnya benar. Mayoritas lagu
memang ditulis dari *1st POV*, tapi ada sebagian kecil lagu yang tidak
ditulis demikian.

Apa saja lagunya?

Lagu bukan 1st POV

Beberapa lagu yang familiar di telinga saya seperti `All You Need is
Love`, `Lady Madonna`, dan `Lucy in The Sky with Diamonds` ternyata
memang tidak mengandung kata eksplisit *1st POV*.

## Kata Terpenting dalam Lagu *The Beatles*

Sekarang saya akan melihat dari semua lagu *The Beatles* kata apa yang
terpenting. Kata apa yang menjadi pusat perhatian dari rangkaian lirik
*The Beatles*?

Untuk menjawabnya, saya akan gunakan *bigram analysis*, yakni melihat
pasangan kata yang muncul bersamaan.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikanx101/ikanx101.github.io/master/_posts/data%20carpentry/the%20beatles/Journal-Beatles_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />

Agak rumit yah graf di atas.

Ada beberapa cara menentukan pusat dari graf.

1.  *Degree*: *For finding very connected words, popular words, words
    which can quickly connect with the wider network.*
2.  *Betweenness*: *For finding the words which influence the flow
    around a system.*

Berikut adalah hasil perhitungan dari graf di atas:

| words | degree |   between |
| :---- | -----: | --------: |
| you   |    134 | 30598.741 |
| i     |    124 | 27107.517 |
| the   |     73 | 13773.298 |
| me    |     67 | 10915.729 |
| to    |     59 | 10919.398 |
| a     |     54 |  9603.176 |
| and   |     46 |  9585.461 |
| s     |     45 | 10552.384 |
| my    |     33 |  5962.631 |
| it    |     32 |  3929.178 |
| t     |     30 |  5118.419 |
| be    |     27 |  4435.864 |
| that  |     26 |  4051.371 |
| your  |     24 |  5535.858 |
| love  |     23 |  4851.731 |

15 Kata yang menjadi pusat

Ternyata `you` menjadi kata pusat di semua lirik *The Beatles* TAPI jika
kita lihat dengan seksama, kata-kata *1st POV* seperti `I`, `me`, dan
`my` memiliki index *degree* dan *betweenness* yang tinggi.

## *Degree*

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikanx101/ikanx101.github.io/master/_posts/data%20carpentry/the%20beatles/Journal-Beatles_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" />

## *Between*

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikanx101/ikanx101.github.io/master/_posts/data%20carpentry/the%20beatles/Journal-Beatles_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" />

# *Summary*

Jadi *urban legend* ini tidak sepenuhnya benar. Ada sebagian lagu yang
tidak ditulis dari *1st POV* TAPI kita tidak bisa memungkiri bahwa
kata-kata *1st POV* mendominasi *central gravity* dari lirik-lirik yang
dinyanyikan *The Beatles*.
