```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Setidaknya sudah ada empat artikel yang sudah saya tulis terkait Large Language Model yang saya dapatkan dari situs Huggingface. Salah satu artikel yang menarik dan bermanfaat bagi saya adalah LLM untuk merangkum data berupa teks atau tulisan.

Kali ini saya akan melakukan hal serupa, yakni mencoba LLM dari Huggingface terkait summarization alias merangkum. Bedanya dengan artikel sebelumnya adalah:

> Saya akan merangkum teks berupa percakapan.

Tentu ini adalah hal yang menarik karena kalimat yang digunakan dalam percakapan tentu berbeda dengan kalimat pada tulisan.

Pertanyaannya:

> Apakah LLM bisa merangkum percakapan dengan baik?

Mari kita coba.

# Kasus I

Rita: Hey Tina? Is it you?
Tina: Oh Rita! How are you? It’s been a long time.
Rita: I am fine, what about you? Yes, we last met during the board exams.
Tina: I’m good too.
Rita: What are you doing now?
Tina: Well, I have started my undergraduate studies in English Honours at St. Xaviers College in Mumbai.
Rita: Wow! You finally got to study the subject you loved the most in school.
Tina: True. What about you Rita? Wasn’t History your favourite subject?
Rita: You guessed it right. I took up History Honours in Lady Shri Ram College for Women in Delhi.
Tina: That’s nice. I am so happy for you.
Rita: I am happy for you too. Let’s meet up again soon.

# Kasus II

Bank Clerk: Good morning, welcome to the Grammar Bank. How can I help you?
Customer: Good morning. I would like to open a bank account.
Bank Clerk: Sure thing. What kind of account would you like to open? A savings account or a checking account?
Customer: What's the difference?
Bank Clerk: A checking account is designed to use for everyday transactions. Yet; the money in a savings account is meant to stay in the account and earn interest over time.
Customer: I see, actually I want to apply for a credit card. That's why I need an account.
Bank Clerk: Okay then, you probably want a checking account.
Customer: Well, thank you. I'd like that.
Bank Clerk: Sure, we will have you fill out an application form, please.
Customer: No problem.
Bank Clerk: How much of a credit limit were you looking for?
Customer:I would like a $10,000 spending limit.
Bank Clerk: Alright, we will see what we can do. We might be able to get you one of our gold cards with a $10,000 spending limit.
Customer: Wonderful. Will I also collect points when I use the card?
Bank Clerk: Sure, with our gold card you will get 10 reward points for every dollar spent.
Customer: Perfect, I have filled out the form. Do you need anything else?
Bank Clerk: You just need to deposit a minimum of $250 into your new checking account.
Customer: Very well, here you are.
Bank Clerk: Thank you, your account is set up now and your credit card will be mailed to your address within 5 to 10 business days.
Customer: Thank you for your help, have a good day.
