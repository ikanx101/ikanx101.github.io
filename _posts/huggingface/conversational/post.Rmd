Bank Clerk: Good morning, welcome to the Grammar Bank. How can I help you?
Customer: Good morning. I would like to open a bank account.
Bank Clerk: Sure thing. What kind of account would you like to open? A savings account or a checking account?
Customer: What's the difference?
Bank Clerk: A checking account is designed to use for everyday transactions. Yet; the money in a savings account is meant to stay in the account and earn interest over time.
Customer: I see, actually I want to apply for a credit card. That's why I need an account.
Bank Clerk: Okay then, you probably want a checking account.
Customer: Well, thank you. I'd like that.
Bank Clerk: Sure, we will have you fill out an application form, please.
Customer: No problem.
Bank Clerk: How much of a credit limit were you looking for?
Customer:I would like a $10,000 spending limit.
Bank Clerk: Alright, we will see what we can do. We might be able to get you one of our gold cards with a $10,000 spending limit.
Customer: Wonderful. Will I also collect points when I use the card?
Bank Clerk: Sure, with our gold card you will get 10 reward points for every dollar spent.
Customer: Perfect, I have filled out the form. Do you need anything else?
Bank Clerk: You just need to deposit a minimum of $250 into your new checking account.
Customer: Very well, here you are.
Bank Clerk: Thank you, your account is set up now and your credit card will be mailed to your address within 5 to 10 business days.
Customer: Thank you for your help, have a good day.

Doctor: About a week but she can continue for another week if she doesn't feel better. She should probably rest for a few days too and not go to school.

Doctor: It's probably the fever, she may have caught the infection from anyone.
Patient's mother: Can she take a shower?
