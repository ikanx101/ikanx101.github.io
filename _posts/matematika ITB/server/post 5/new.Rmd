## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-rstudio-server \
    --allow tcp:8787 \
    --target-tags rstudio-server
```

```
gcloud compute instances add-tags [INSTANCE_NAME] --tags rstudio-server
```
